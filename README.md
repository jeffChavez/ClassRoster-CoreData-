ClassRoster-CoreData-
=====================

This app displays the names of students and teachers for our iOS Code Fellows class inside of a `UITableView`. Upon selecting a person, the user is taken to a `DetailViewController` where they can see specific attributes of that person, like a picture, first and last name, github username, and role. This data is persisted using CoreData.

The user can retrieve a GitHub profile image associated with the username they type in the textfield.

The user can select a photo from their photo album, or take a picture from their camera.
